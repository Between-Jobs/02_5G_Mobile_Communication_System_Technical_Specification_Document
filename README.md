# 5G Mobile Communication System Technical Specification

Using a free generative AI tool, I have created a 5G Mobile Communication System Technical Specification Document according to the table of contents below.  
I instructed the AI to output in a format that is easy for me to understand and remember.

I highly encourage you to follow the same format and create your own customized 5G Mobile Communication System Technical Specification Document.  
This will help you quickly grasp the overall picture of 5G system technical specifications.
